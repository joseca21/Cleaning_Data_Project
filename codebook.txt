FIELDS INCLUDED IN 'AGGREGATED' TIDY FILE SUBMITTED
---------------------------------------------------

The fields included in the tidy dataset submitted average both means and standard deviations for: 
- time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time), which includes some 3-axial raw signals (XYZ)
- frequency domain signals (prefix 'f' to indicate frequency), which also includes some 3-axial raw signals (XYZ)

1) The fields used to aggregate the average doamin signals are:
- Activity Name - Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
                  wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
- Subject ID - The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
               
2) The time domain signals (aggregated by their average mean or standard deviation) are as follows: 
- tBodyAcc-XYZ
- tGravityAcc-XYZ
- tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
- tBodyGyro-XYZ
- tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
- tBodyAccMag
- tGravityAccMag
- tBodyAccJerkMag
- tBodyGyroMag
- tBodyGyroJerkMag
** Please note '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions for some of above signals.

3) The frequency domain signals (aggregated by their average mean or standard deviation) are as follows: 
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
** Please note '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions for some of the above signals.




TRANSFORMATIONS(see '*' below) AND VARIABLES USED (see '#' below)
-------------------------------------


1) QUESTION 1:


TEST SET

# Xtest_1: Data.frame containing Test set from 'test/X_test.txt' (exludes headers)
# Header_Train_Test: Data.frame containing List of all features (headers for Test/Train data) from 'features.txt'
# T_Header_Train_Set: Data.frame containing transpose 2nd column -column $V2- of Header_Train_Test. 
                      Data transposed from rows to columns.

* Transposed headers (i.e. T_Header_Train_Set) were added to initial Test set (i.e. Xtest_1) using colnames(Xtest_1) <- T_Header_Train_Set

# ytest_1: Data.frame containing the activity IDs for Test set from 'test/y_test.txt' (excluding headers)
# subjecttest_1: Data.frame containing subjects who peformed activities measured in Test set. Extracted from 'test/subject_test.txt' (exc. headers)

# test_subj_activ: Data.frame containing merged Subject IDs (subjecttest_1) with Activity IDs (ytest_1) 

* Activity and subject descriptive headers were added to test_subj_activ data.frame using colnames(test_subj_activ) <- c("subjectID","activityID")

# Xtest_2: Data.frame containing merged Activity and subject IDs (test_subj_activ) with Test set (Xtest_1). This is the final test dataset.


TRAINING SET

# Xtrain_1: Data.frame containing Test set from 'train/X_train.txt'  (exludes headers)

* Transposed headers (i.e. T_Header_Train_Set) are added to initial Training set (i.e. Xtrain_1) using colnames(Xtrain_1) <- T_Header_Train_Set

# ytrain_1: Data.frame containing the activity IDs for Training set from 'train/y_train.txt'  (excluding headers)
# subjecttrain_1: Data.frame containing subjects who peformed activities measured in Training set. Extracted from 'train/subject_train.txt'  (exc. headers)

# train_subj_activ: Data.frame containing merged Subject IDs (subjecttrain_1) with Activity IDs (ytrain_1) 

* Activity and subject descriptive headers are added to train_subj_activ data.frame using colnames(train_subj_activ) <- c("subjectID","activityID")

# Xtrain_2: Data.frame containing merged Activity and subject IDs (train_subj_activ) with Training set (Xtrain_1). This is the final training dataset.


MERGED FILE WITH HEADERS (Test + Training set)

# MergedData: Data.frame containing Merged Test and Training Data Sets (it includes headers). It has 10,299 rows and 563 features (fields).




2) QUESTION 2:

# Mean_Std: Using 'grepl', the Mean_Std variable was created to include any field headers (from MergedData data.frame) which contain either "mean(" OR "std(" OR "subject" OR "activity".
            The last 2 options were used to include ActivityID and SubjectID fields which will be later used for aggregation purposes.

# MergedData2: Data.frame containing only the fields which header is included (i.e. TRUE) in Mean_Std variable. This new dataset now includes only 68 fields (and still 10,299 rows)




3) QUESTION 3:

# Activity_Labels: Data.frame containing Activity Names (as well as Activity IDs) from activity_labels.txt (excluding headers)

* Descriptive names are then added to Activity_Labels dataset are added to Activity_Labels data.frame using colnames(Activity_Labels) <- c("activityID","activityName")

# MergedData3: Merged Data.frame containing Master Dataset from Question 2 (MergedData2) plus the Activity Names field. This dataset has 69 fields (as Activity Name has now been merged)

# MergedData4: Data.frame containing re-arranged fields from previous file (MergedData3). This data.frame contains 68 fields bacause Activity ID has been removed (as we now have Activity Name in the dataset)




4) QUESTION 4:

* Brackets () are removed from all measurement headers to tidy up data labels.
  The headers naming convention used for signals is as follows: [time/frequency domain signal].[mean/std].[axial raw XYZ- if applicable]
  COde used to tidy up headers is as follows: names(MergedData4) <- gsub("\\(\\)", "", names(MergedData4))




5) QUESTION 5:

# Agg_MergedData4: Data.frame containing aggregated tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* As the aggregate function changes the names of the 2 fields used for aggregation to Group.n, original tidy names are changed back to "Subject ID" and "Activity Name"



Final output from question 5 is then exported to txt. fileand saved in root directory Exports data to a comma delimited text file.
This is the tidy dataset uploaded for this assignment.
To read this tidy dataset, the following code can be used: read.csv("Aggregated_Merged_TidyData_GalaxyS.txt", sep="")
